This is my summary of the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).

<Highlight color="green">I like to read and make highlights of the parts that I think are more important</Highlight>. This reading approach helps me absorb the content better. This post is a collection of my highlights tailored to my own life and experience.

## Preface

I've starting reading this book to become a better programmer. This content will be full of <Highlight color="green">tips to incorporate into your own professional life</Highlight>.

Pragmatism is all about the practical side of things, from beliefs and theories to practical consequences and real-world applications.

Pragmatic programmers exibits the following characteristics:

- **Early adopter / faster adapter**: you need to be able to learn new things quickly and adapt to new situations, never stop learning. **Your confidence is born of experience.**
- **Inquisitive**: you ask questions and seek answers, you are <Tooltip content="a person who collects and hoards things, as a hobby.">a pack rat</Tooltip> for small bits of information.
- **Critical thinker**: you rarely take things as given, you question assumptions and challenge the status quo.
- **Realistic**: you don't get caught up in fantasies, you focus on the practical aspects of the situation, with a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things will take.
- **Jack of all trades**: you don't need to be an expert in everything, but you <Tooltip content="to stay informed or up-to-date about a topic or situation.">keep abreast</Tooltip> of new developments.

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well? There's no point.

<Alert type="tip">
  Care about your craft. 
</Alert>

Think about what you're doing while you're doing it.

<Alert type="tip">
  Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.
</Alert>

It's a continuous process. Great <Tooltip content="a carefully maintained area of grass.">lawns</Tooltip> need small amounts of daily care. _Kaizen_ (改善) is the Japanese concept of continuously making many small improvements.

## Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

Pragmatic programmers think beyond the immediate problem. They won't sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect. They like to keep them <Tooltip content="clean and fresh as if new; spotless.">pristine</Tooltip>, keeping the momentum up.

A big <Tooltip content="an important quality or feature on which a particular thing depends or is based.">cornerstone</Tooltip> of this philosophy is that you need to **take responsibility for yourself and your actions in terms of your career advancement, your project, and your day-to-day work**, not being afraid to admit ignorance or mistakes. No matter how thorough your planning, testing, documentation and automation is, you will always encounter unexpected problems. Pragmatic programmers deal with them professionally by being proactive and taking responsibility.

To achieve this, you must analyze the situation for risks that are beyond your control, admitting it honestly and trying to offer options. Don't blame someone or something else, neither make up lame excuses. It's up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

<Alert type="tip">
  Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.
</Alert>

When you're about to approach someone trying to say why something can't be done, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does it sound reasonable, or stupid? Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say?

One broken window, left unrepaired, will soon become a haven for vandals. Don't live with broken windows, it can deteriorate functional systems pretty quickly. Fight software entropy.

<Alert type="tip">
  Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.
</Alert>

You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. Work out what you can reasonable ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show to people, let them marvel. People find it easier to join an ongoing success. Then say _"of course, it would be better if we added ..."_

<Alert type="tip">
  Be a catalyst for change. You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.
</Alert>

{/* Boiled Frog story. */}

Don't focus too tighly and forget about the rest of the world. Try to minimize things <Tooltip content="to move closer to someone slowly and quietly, without being noticed.">creeping up on you</Tooltip>. It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams. If a frog is put in a pot of boiling water, it will jump out. But if you put it in a pot of cold water and slowly bring the heat up, it will stay in the water until it's too late.

<Alert type="tip">
  Remember the bigger picture. Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you, not just what your personally are doing.
</Alert>

The frog problem is different from the broken windows issue. On the former, people lose the will to fight entropy because they perceive that no one else cares. The frog just doesn't notice the change.
