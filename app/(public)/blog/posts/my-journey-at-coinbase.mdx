I started working at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) on **January 2022**, so that accounts for a total of **<DateRange startDate="2022-01-04" endDate="2024-09-06" />**! I'm documenting my IC4 journey here, so I can look back and see how much I've grown. üöÄ

Everything in here is my personal experience and opinion.

## Starting out üë£

I was previously working at a small startup called [Z1](https://z1.app) ‚Äî a fintech for Brazilian teenagers that offers a bank account app with a Mastercard debit card. I was one of the first hires there, primarily working on [their React Native app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/z1-conta-digital/id1522028830).

The journey from design and implementation to launch was super fast, as you would expect in a startup environment, so I got the chance to wear many hats and learn a lot of new things. At some point, we got into [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/z1) and started to see exponential growth in users and team.

Most of the engineering team was located in [S√£o Paulo, SP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CT5kN9mzVaWmKGyF6) while I was in a remote role working from [Bras√≠lia, DF](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K25tn95wcqmTv8SG7) _(home)_, so I was feeling a bit left out in the primary decision makings when they decided to rent an office at Faria Lima avenue. 

I was feeling like I was accumulating a lot of functions and not really being recognized for my work. I felt like it was a **time for a change**. I wanted to work for a big company alongside smart people and learn from them.

I'm into crypto and at the end of 2021 I started learning more about it based on the web3 boom. Coinbase was one of the companies that were hiring a lot of people and I thought it would be a good fit. I saw an opportunity on X ‚Äî _RIP Twitter ‚ö∞Ô∏è_ ‚Äî about their team [hiring engineers from Brazil](https://x.com/htormey/status/1437758742989312005) and decided to apply. Turns out they were opening the "Coinbase Brazil LTDA" entity, hiring through CLT and paying base salary in Brazilian Reais (BRL/R$) along with RSU shares ($COIN on NASDAQ).

The interview process was pretty standard. I had 4 rounds of interviews:

1. One pair programming to solve a React.js application failing unit tests locally.
2. One pair programming implementing an order book for a crypto exchange with buy and sell buttons, along with a ledger transaction list (+/-). I did it using React Native. As preparation, I decided to recreate the Coinbase app landing page with sign in and sign up forms. The repository is open source and [available here](https://github.com/renanmav/coinbase-repro).
3. One technical interview with a lot of system design questions using [Excalindraw](https://excalidraw.com).
4. One more interview with a manager.

Once I got the offer, I accepted it and started the onboarding process.

## What I do üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- **Frontend work**: joined to help rewrite the Coinbase Wallet app in React Native and also contribute to the Chrome extension development. Tech stack includes:
    - TypeScript
    - React & React Native
    - React Query for data fetching
    - CDS (Coinbase Design System) for UI components
    - Recoil & Jotai for global state management
    - Jest & React Testing Library for unit testing
    - Detox & BrowserStack for E2E testing
- **Some spot-on backend work**: after a lot of time contributing to the frontend, I asked to help with some backend development. I did some minor worksteams in microservices such as WAAS - Web3 Asset Aggregator Service for consolidating asset data info from multiple providers such as Coingecko, Coinmarketcap and others, helping with a refactor to avoid having to redeploy the service in order to pickup config changes. I also helped with backend library `wallet/common` documentation, decomposing README into separate docs. Tech stack includes:
    - Golang
    - Postgres for relational data
    - MongoDB for non-relational data
    - SQS for message queue
    - Redis for cache
    - gRPC for microservices communication
    - Docker for containerization
    - Kubernetes for orchestration
- **PR reviews**: I was known for being very thorough with my reviews, which helped my peers a lot, catching bugs and edge cases early. I did that by enforcing manual review instructions in PR descriptions, git checkout to the branch or downloading one-off builds, and manually testing changes.

## What I've built üö¢

- **[react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) scaffolding**: Coinbase Wallet navigation setup in `apps/rn`, including `TabNavigator` and `StackNavigator`, as well as basic deeplinking setup. At that time, we were using react-navigation v4. It was later updated to v5 and then to v6.
- **Common [ESLint](https://eslint.org) config within monorepo**: we first started with [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) at `wallet/wallet-mobile` repo and then the infra team switched to [NX](https://nx.dev); as one of my first challenges, I pulled out the common config for linting across our monorepo and put it in a separate package `workspaces/libs/eslint-config`.
- **Onboarding flow**: as one of my first feature assigned tasks, I worked on the import and create wallet screens. I had to deal with security concerns because recovery phrases were being asked and displayed at onboarding. I had to disabe clipboard hijacking and screen recording on those sensitive screens. The flow was quite complex, I've mapped out a [state machine here for it here](https://google.com). After some time, there was another effort to implement instant onboarding, reducing the amount of clicks from ~10 to nearly 2. Oh, it also have a warm welcome that displays a pretty [lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie) animation.

- **Decentralized ID onboarding**: an IC5 eng from the identity team was on PTO, so I was assigned to build the screens for claiming your `.cb.id` username, which is a lightweight version of ENS with really cheap gas fees, so we offer this for free to users during onboarding. Coinbase recently launched [basenames](https://www.base.org/names) to the public. _Say hello to [renan.base.eth](https://www.base.org/names/renan.base.eth)!_
- **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy**: a legal requirement for users to acknowledge. Most boring thing ever to implement, but someone has to do it. And that someone was me. At first, I thought about not breaking the DRY principle by rendereing a [pre-existing TOS page](https://wallet.coinbase.com/terms-of-service) within a webview, but due security reasons, I had to keep a copy of the page in our app. _Make sure you don't freeze the app on startup when implementing a fullscreen modal takeover ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_
- **A/B experiments to improve funding rates**: NFT incentives that were delivered once the first funding was completed, CTAs to launch the buy flow on different parts of the app, etc.
- **One click buy flow on CBPay (at [pay.coinbase.com](https://pay.coinbase.com))**: built a buy flow at `payments/onramp-widget` which is a repo from another internal team called CBPay (recently renamed to Coinbase Onramp). This flow was presented inside Wallet via webview. 
- **Buy flow**: one of the core features of the app. It's a complex flow that involves geo checks, amount input, asset, network and payment method selection, quote fetching, execution, KYC checks, 2-step verification, deeplinking, Coinbase account connection and **A LOT of edge cases** üòµ‚Äçüí´. Standarized with an `useLaunchBuyFlow` hook and React context based `OnrampContext`. I was not the main author of this flow, but I contributed to it significantly. Present on the following platforms:
    - React Native
    - Panorama - [wallet.coinbase.com](https://wallet.coinbase.com)
    - Smart contract wallet - [keys.coinbase.com](https://keys.coinbase.com)
<YoutubeVideo videoId="V2rio-Sa128" title="Buy flow" aspectRatio="9:19.5" />
- **[MeshConnect](https://www.meshconnect.com) integration**: a vendor that allows transfers from different exchanges such as Binance, Robinhood, etc. It included the implementation of their RN SDK into `wallet/wallet-mobile`, and a backend proxy service at `wallet/payment-provider-aggregator` to inject the API key and secret values into request headers as per advice of [their docs](https://docs.meshconnect.com/guides/link-initialization#getting-your-api-keys) and our app security team.

## What I've learned üß†

- Efficient execution
- Clear and proactive communication
- Being a team player
- The importance of thorough testing
- Written planning of work and communication/feedback

## What I like üëç

- Working with great and smart people
- Crypto-foward environment
- Well-known product
- US company
- Remote-friendly

## What I don't like üò¢

- **Not learning new things**: just doing the same thing over and over again, not challenged to do things differently, pretty much in the comfort zone.
- **Work-life balance**: hard to disconnect from work, with most of my team working EST hours, specially my manager. It also had to attend oncall rotations, which was a pain, getting paged at 2am and having to respond to incidents which you have no context.
- **Promo cycle**: it's very slow and there's no clear path to get a raise. Been there for almost 3 years and never got a raise. I didn't have a lot of shoutouts and kudos.
- **Management style**: I had a total of 3 manager changes. My first one was very hands off and gave me a lot of freedom. My last one was not very supportive. Feedback was not always specific and clear, most of the times it's vague and general, often repeating the same things over and over again. I didn't have a manager that really helped me grow in my career.
- **Startup wanna-be but not really**: it's a big company with a startup mindset, but it's still a big company. Lot's of bureaucracy and processes that slow down the pace of work. Engineers are encouraged to run through the brick walls, which is a good thing.

## What's next? üí≠

I was terminated on **September 6, 2024**. My manager told me it was lack of perf, but all [my performance reviews were on-track](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pKIeMI5dSsfYxEWbFxyemb-XBKd7N5q2). I didn't get a warning or a chance to improve. I'm not really sure what happened, probably some internal politics or downsizing due bear market. It was out of the blue, he just pulled me into a 1:1 meeting with an HR rep and told me the news.

`¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

I'm looking for my next role. If you know of any good opportunities, [please reach out to me](/contact). I'm looking for a remote-friendly company that pays in USD or USDC or BTC, with a good work-life balance and interesting culture. It can be web, mobile or backend focused. All pieces are welcome! üòâ
