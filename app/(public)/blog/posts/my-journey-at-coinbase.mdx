I started working at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) on **January 2022**, so that accounts for **<DateRange startDate="2022-01-04" endDate="2024-09-06" />**! I'm documenting my IC4 journey here, so I can look back and see how much I've grown. üöÄ

Everything in here is my personal experience and opinion.

## Starting out üö∂üèª‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

I was previously working at a small startup called [Z1](https://z1.app) ‚Äî a fintech for Brazilian teenagers that offers a bank account app with a Mastercard debit card. I was one of the first hires there, primarily working on [their React Native app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/z1-conta-digital/id1522028830).

The journey from design and implementation to launch was super fast, as you would expect in a startup environment, so I got the chance to wear many hats and learn a lot of new things. At some point, we got into YCombinator and started to see exponential growth in users and team.

Most of the engineering team was located in [S√£o Paulo, SP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CT5kN9mzVaWmKGyF6) while I was in a remote role working from [Bras√≠lia, DF](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K25tn95wcqmTv8SG7) _(home)_, so I was feeling a bit left out in the primary decision makings when they decided to rent an office at Faria Lima avenue. 

I was feeling like I was accumulating a lot of functions and not really being recognized for my work. I felt like it was a **time for a change**. I wanted to work for a big company alongside smart people and learn from them.

I'm into crypto and at the end of 2021 I started learning more about it based on the web3 boom. Coinbase was one of the companies that were hiring a lot of people and I thought it would be a good fit. I saw an opportunity on X ‚Äî _RIP Twitter ‚ö∞Ô∏è_ ‚Äî that [Harry Tormey](https://x.com/htormey) posted about his team [hiring engineers from Brazil](https://x.com/htormey/status/1437758742989312005) and decided to apply.

The interview process was pretty standard. I had 4 rounds of interviews:

1. One pair programming to solve a React.js application failing unit tests locally.
1. One pair programming implementing a order book for a crypto exchange with buy and sell buttons, along with a ledger transaction list (+/-). I did it using React Native. As preparation, I decided to recreate the Coinbase app landing page with sign in and sign up forms. The repository is open source and [available here](https://github.com/renanmav/coinbase-repro).
1. One technical interview with a lot of system design questions. I did it using [Excalindraw](https://excalidraw.com).
1. One more interview with a manager.

Once I got the offer, I accepted it and started the onboarding process.

## What I do üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- **Frontend work**: TypeScript, React, React Native, React Query, CDS (Coinbase Design System), Recoil / Jotai, Jest, React Testing Library, Detox, etc.
- **Some spot-on backend work**: Golang, Postgres, SQS, Redis, Docker, etc.
- **PR reviews**: I was known for being very thorough with my reviews, which helped my team members a lot, catching edge cases and potential bugs early in development phase. I did that by manually checking in to the branch or downloading one-off builds, ask for manual review instructions of that given change to be added into the PR description, manually review and actually test changes. Ever since a initiative to improve code quality called internally PRG, I was dedicating a lot of time to it. 

## What I've built üö¢

1. **[react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) scaffolding**: of Coinbase Wallet `apps/rn`.
1. **Common ESLint config within monorepo**: we first started with yarn workspaces at wallet/wallet-mobile repo and then switched to NX; as one of my first challenges, I pulled out the common config for linting across our packages and put it in a separate monorepo package `workspaces/libs/eslint-config`.
1. **Onboarding flow**:
1. **Decentralized ID onboarding**: (.cb.id)
1. **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy**: a legal requirement for users to acknowledge. Most boring thing ever to implement, but someone has to do it. And that someone was me. At first, I thought about not breaking the DRY principle by rendereing a pre-existing TOS page within a webview. Don't freeze the app on startup.
1. **One click buy flow on CBPay (at [pay.coinbase.com](https://pay.coinbase.com))**: built a buy flow at `payments/onramp-widget` which is a repo from another internal team called CBPay (recently renamed to Coinbase Onramp).
1. Buy flow
  1. React Native
  1. Panorama
  1. Smart contract wallet
1. **MeshConnect**: including the implementation of their RN SDK into `wallet/wallet-mobile`, and a backend proxy service at `wallet/payment-provider-aggregator` to inject secret values into request headers as per advice of docs and security team.

## What I've learned üß†

- Efficient execution
- Clear and proactive communication
- Being a team player
- The importance of thorough testing
- Written planning of work and communication/feedback

## What I like üëç

- Working with great and smart people
- Crypto-foward environment
- Well-known product
- US company
- Remote-friendly

## What I don't like üôÅ

- **Work-life balance**: hard to disconnect from work, with most of my team working EST hours, specially my manager.
- **Useless meetings**: a lot of meetings are not necessary, especially when it's a recurring one. Some decisions that could have been made asynchronously were made in a meeting wasting everyone's time.
- **Promo cycle**: it's very slow and there's no clear path to get a raise. I worked there for almost 3 years and never got a raise.
- **Management style**: it's very micromanagement-y and there's a lot of politics involved. Feedback is not always specific and clear, most of the times it's vague and general, often repeating the same things over and over again. I didn't have a manager that really helped me grow in my career.
- **Startup wanna-be but not really**: it's a big company with a startup mindset, but it's still a big company. Lot's of bureaucracy and processes that slow down the pace of work. Some engineers try to do things the "right" way, but it's not the best way to ship things.

## What's next? üí≠

I was terminated on **September 6, 2024**. My manager told me it was lack of performance, but all [my performance reviews were on track](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pKIeMI5dSsfYxEWbFxyemb-XBKd7N5q2), so I'm not sure what happened. Probably some internal politics or downsizing. I didn't get a warning or a chance to improve. It was out of the blue, he just pulled me into a 1:1 meeting with an HR rep and told me the news.

`¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

I'm looking for my next role. If you know of any opportunities, [please reach out to me](/contact). I'm looking for a remote-friendly company with a good work-life balance, a USD paying salary, and a good culture.
