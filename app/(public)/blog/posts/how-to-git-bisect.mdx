`git bisect` is a command that helps you find the commit that introduced a bug through binary search. It's a very useful tool when you have a regression in your codebase.

## How to use it

1. Start by finding the last good commit.
2. Find a following bad commit.

The more narrow the range you give to `git bisect`, the better.

## Example

Let's solve a real-world problem using `git bisect`.

I noticed a small bug on Bun CLI when using short flags. Check this GitHub issue https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/7114.

I'm using `bun@1.0.8` and the issue mentions that it worked correctly on `1.0.7`.

### Find the last good commit

So, the first thing I want to do is to find the last good commit. We'll use the following command to find the commit hash of `1.0.7`:

```bash
git rev-list -n 1 bun-v1.0.7
```

It outputs the following **good** commit hash:

```bash
b0393fba6200d8573f3433fb0af258a0e33ac157
```

### Find the bad commit

Now, we need to find the commit that introduced the bug.

We'll use the following command to find the commit hash of `1.0.8`:

```bash
git rev-list -n 1 bun-v1.0.8
```

It outputs the following **bad** commit hash:

```bash
2a405f691e80725fe0b97b93afd3b8cfed13fa5f
```

### Run `git bisect`

Now, we can start using `git bisect` to find the commit that introduced the bug.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect good b0393fba6200d8573f3433fb0af258a0e33ac157
git bisect bad 2a405f691e80725fe0b97b93afd3b8cfed13fa5f
```

It outputs the following:

```bash
Bisecting: 30 revisions left to test after this (roughly 5 steps)
[4ff54139b7922f006f862d548e1c3c3345716d2f] fix(ci): typo
```

It means that there are 30 commits left to test.

We can see that there are 5 steps left to test.
