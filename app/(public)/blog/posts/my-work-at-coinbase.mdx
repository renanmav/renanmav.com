I started working at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) on **January 2022**, so that accounts for **<DateRange startDate="2022-01-04" endDate="2024-09-06" />**! I'm documenting my IC4 journey here, so I can look back and see how much I've grown. üöÄ

## Starting out üö∂üèª‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

{/* You're being too negative about Z1. They were a small team and you were one of the first hires. You should be proud of that. */}

I was previously working at a small startup called [Z1](https://z1.app). I was one of the first hires there, primarily working on [their React Native app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/z1-conta-digital/id1522028830). It's a fintech for Brazilian teenagers that offers a bank account app with a Mastercard debit card.

Most of the engineering team was located in [S√£o Paulo, SP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CT5kN9mzVaWmKGyF6) while I was in a remote role working from [Bras√≠lia, DF](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K25tn95wcqmTv8SG7) _(home)_, so I was feeling a bit left out in the primary decision makings when they decided to rent an office at Faria Lima Avenue. 

I was feeling like I was accumulating a lot of functions and not really being recognized for my work. I felt like it was a **time for a change**. I wanted to work for a big company alongside smart people and learn from them.

I'm into crypto and at the end of 2021 I started learning more about it based on the web3 boom. Coinbase was one of the companies that were hiring a lot of people and I thought it would be a good fit. I saw an opportunity on X's _(RIP Twitter ‚ö∞Ô∏è)_ that [Harry Tormey](https://x.com/htormey) posted about his team [hiring engineers from Brazil](https://x.com/htormey/status/1437758742989312005) and decided to apply.

## What I do üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- Frontend work
- Some spot-on backend work
- PR reviews
- Manually review and test changes

## What I've built üö¢

1. [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) scaffolding of Coinbase Wallet `apps/rn`.
1. Common ESLint config within monorepo: we first started with yarn workspaces at wallet/wallet-mobile repo and then switched to NX; as one of my first challenges, I pulled out the common config for linting across our packages and put it in a separate monorepo package `workspaces/libs/eslint-config`.
1. Onboarding flow
1. Decentralized ID onboarding (.cb.id)
1. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
1. One click buy flow on CBPay (at [pay.coinbase.com](https://pay.coinbase.com)): built a buy flow at `payments/onramp-widget` which is a repo from another internal team called CBPay (recently renamed to Coinbase Onramp).
1. Buy flow
  1. React Native
  1. Panorama
  1. Smart contract wallet

{/* TODO: attach performance reviews */}

## What I like üëç

- Crypto-foward environment
- Well-known product

## What I don't like ü§Æ

- Work-life balance
- Useless meetings
- Promo cycle
- Management style
- Startup wanna-be but not really

## What's next? üí≠

I was terminated on **September 6, 2024**. My manager told me it was lack of performance, but all my performance reviews were on track, so I'm not sure what happened. Probably some internal politics or downsizing. I didn't get a warning or a chance to improve. It was very out of the blue, he just pulled me into a 1:1 meeting with an HR rep and told me the news.

`¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

I'm looking for my next role. If you know of any opportunities, [please reach out to me](/contact). I'm looking for a remote-friendly company with a good work-life balance, a USD paying salary, and a good culture.
