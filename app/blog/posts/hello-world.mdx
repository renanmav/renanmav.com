Hello, world! This is my new blog. It's using MDX and Next.js. I'm so excited to share my thoughts.

<div className="relative">
  <img src="/renanmav.png" width="300px" />
  <img src="/arrow-pointing-at-me.svg" className="absolute top-[270px] left-[250px]" />
  <p className="font-semibold absolute top-[315px] left-[350px]">yup, that's me!</p>
</div>

You can find my old blog at [renanmav.github.io](https://renanmav.github.io), but I won't be updating it anymore. Started it back in 2019, at that time I was finishing college and aspiring to be a data scientist. Now, I'm a professional software engineer and I want to share my thoughts in a more professional way.
