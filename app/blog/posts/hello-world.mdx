Hello, world! This is my new blog. It's using MDX and Next.js! It's also [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/renanmav/renanmav.com).

Looking forward to share my thoughts here. ðŸ¤“

You can find my old blog at [renanmav.github.io](https://renanmav.github.io) _(cringe)_, but I won't be updating it anymore. Started it back in 2019, at that time I was finishing college and aspiring to be a data scientist. Now, I'm a professional software engineer and I want to share my thoughts in a more professional way.
