Hello, world! This is my new blog. It's using MDX and Next.js. I'm so excited to share my thoughts.

TODO: add a photo of me.

You can find my old blog at [renanmav.github.io](https://renanmav.github.io), but I won't be updating it anymore. Started it back in 2019, at that time I was finishing college and aspiring to be a data scientist. Now, I'm a professional software engineer and I want to share my thoughts in a more professional way.
